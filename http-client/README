============================
COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION
============================

This project is based on Maven. To compile/install this client, just do:

    mvn compile package

The result will be an jar-archive in the ``target`` directory.

If you want to use the contrib script ``run.sh`` (see below), you will need
the jars of the dependencies as well. Therefore, just do:

    mvn compile package dependency:copy-dependencies

This command will compile the sources, build a jar of those and download the
depending jar archives to ``target/dependency``.


=============
CONFIGURATION
=============

Currently, this client reads two configuration files:

    - the artifact configuration (conf/demo-config.conf)
    - the logging configuration (conf/log4j.properties)


==================
RUNNING THE CLIENT
==================

There is a bash script that might be used to
start the console based client. Note, that you need the jars of the depending
libraries in the ``target`` directory.

    sh bin/run.sh
